## Special Feature - Public Database

Results of the bypass is hosted on public database on [DBHub.io](https://dbhub.io/bipinkrish/link_bypass.db) so if the bot finds link alredy in database it uses the result from the same, time saved and so many problems will be solved.

Table is creted with the below command, if anyone wants to use it for thier own.

```sql
CREATE TABLE results (link TEXT PRIMARY KEY, result TEXT)
```
